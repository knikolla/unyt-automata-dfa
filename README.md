Assignment 2 - Decidability
=================

In this assignment you will work with decidability problems regarding finite automata. More specifilly you will implement a problem that reads the description of a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), asks for input strings, and decides whether these strings are accepted by the NFA. You are free to use any representation of the NFA that you want to. However, you are required to
* design a data structure for NFA* design a data structure for Deterministic Finite Automata* read the actual NFA from a text file* convert the NFA to its equivalent DFA* determine whether the input string is accepted by the equivalent DFA
